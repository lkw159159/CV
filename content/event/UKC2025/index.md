**Background**<br>
With full support from the Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation, I will attend to UKC 2025 as a presenter at the Medical and Pharmaceutical Science symposium.  
Additionally, to gain the opportunity to engage with senior experts and receive valuable advice for establishing myself as an independent researcher, I will participate in the SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS EARLY CAREER DEVELOPMENT (SEED) 2025 program.
