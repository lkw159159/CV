*Transcriptomic AI-based classification of immune phenotypes for predicting immunotherapy response in lung cancer*

<br>

**Main**<br>
With full support from the Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation, I will attend to UKC 2025 as a presenter at the Medical and Pharmaceutical Science symposium. <br> 
Additionally, to gain the opportunity to engage with senior experts and receive valuable advice for establishing myself as an independent researcher, I will participate in the SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS EARLY CAREER DEVELOPMENT (SEED) 2025 program.
