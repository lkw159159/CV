      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on RNA-based Precision Medicine (RPM) for disease diagnosis and prognosis prediction. I evaluate the impact of RNA-seq data preprocessing on machine learning model performance, identifying optimal normalization and scaling methods to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

        A key aspect of my work is developing predictive models for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response, leveraging immune infiltration profiles to estimate therapeutic outcomes. I also explore immune phenotyping to better understand disease progression and treatment response.

        Additionally, I integrate biomarker discovery and survival analysis, using transcriptomic signatures to improve prognostic modeling. Moving forward, I aim to apply single-cell RNA sequencing to validate findings and enhance translational relevance. My ultimate goal is to advance precision medicine approaches for personalized disease management.
